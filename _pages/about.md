I am an AI researcher with a history as a software developer and freelancer. I am currently pursuing my PhD at the Queen Mary University of London. I am conducting my PhD in collaboration with [Creative Assembly](https://www.creative-assembly.com/) and the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence (IGGI)](https://www.iggi-phd.org/).

I am fascinated by the idea of fully autonomous AI that continuously acquires new knowledge and skills as it interacts with its environment. While I am interested in many topics, my research focuses mainly on creating AI for games using reinforcement learning, meta-learning, and large language models. 

For my PhD, with support from Creative Assembly, I am researching how to use large language models to test games and create zero-shot game agents. My most recent research has used GPT-4 to create [NetPlay](https://github.com/CommanderCero/NetPlay), the first LLM-powered zero-shot agent for the extremely challenging roguelike NetHack.
